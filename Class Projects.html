<p>For this project, I had to talk about an important figure in the world of computer science and their impact on the industry. I chose to talk about Steve Wozniak, the tech pioneer who co-created Apple and changed how people saw computers. I informed others about his life and mainly why he is acknowledged as an important figure for the tech world.</p>

<p>For this project, we had to ceate a website for the ICT SHSM program in All Saints. Lots of collaboration was needed to create this into a reality and the end result was amazing.</p>

<p>With this coding software, we used python to create various images. These group assignments helped us visualize our code, which eventually helped us when we did assignments for replit.</p>
<br>
<p>Lab Activities: Before starting our RST, we tested our coding knowledge with two lab activities. The first one was to create calculators and the second was to make a little quiz. This greatly helped as a refresher for the RST.</p>
