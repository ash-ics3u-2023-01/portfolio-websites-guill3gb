<p>For this project, I had to talk about an important figure in the world of computer science and their impact on the industry. I chose to talk about Steve Wozniak, the tech pioneer who co-created Apple and changed how people saw computers. I informed others about his life and mainly why he is acknowledged as an important figure for the tech world.</p>
