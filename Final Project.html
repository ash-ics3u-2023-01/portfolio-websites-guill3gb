<a href="https://guill3gb.github.io/GuillermoDiegoRST/">Ultimate Calculator</a>
<br>
<p>For our final project, me and Diego decided to create a website that would serve as a calculator, providing users with the ability to figure out various calculations that are done on a daily basis. We went above and beyond by working in Python and HTML and it demonstrates how much we have learned thanks to the ICS3U class. Lots of effort went into making the calculator run properly in the HTML website and more effort was put into making the website an easy place to navigate. The python code was done to ensure that there wasn't any syntax errors and it used various Python techniques that were taught throughout the semester. Overall, we worked really hard and it was a great way to end the course.</p>
